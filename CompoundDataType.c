/* Compound data types allow us to store multiple values stored under each variable for example: an array. The values of a compund data types are all the same data type. But you can also have a compound data type, which has different data types inside it. Such as a structue. A structure is more or less similar to a "class" however a struct only contains info, it doesn't have fn's so there is no behaviour present in a struct.*
